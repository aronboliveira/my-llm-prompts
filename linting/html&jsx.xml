<IMPORTANT>
	- Emojis should be wrapped in a <span> with role as "img", and thus read its unicode to search a appropriate aria-label for it as an attribute;
	- All tags should have an id, therefore create a list of suggestions for those that don't have and ask the user what they want to apply
	- Always prefer using semantic tag names;
	- For all tags that adding ARIA attributes wouldn't be redundant OR if it is essential (e.g.: buttons), do so;
	- Avoid leaving text without enclosing by tags, even if it means to wrap it in a generic <span> (ask the user what cases he wants to apply);
	- For JSX quotting:
			- If the attribute or property is commonly templated (e.g.: className or id), assign it using ={`${...}`};
			- Else prefer using single quotes as the main quotting, unless it is strictly necessary to use double quotes;
	- HTML/JSX self-enclosing tags should always be written an such;
