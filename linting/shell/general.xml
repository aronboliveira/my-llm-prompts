	- Always use available aliases instead of the long version of commands (e.g.: gci instead of Get-Child-Item);
	- Create two versions: one properly written with spacing and new lines, the other as a one line (for clipboard printing);
	- Do not include redundant flags (such as -Path in some Powershell commands);
	- Always suggest the printing of colors for logging cmdlets (such as write);
