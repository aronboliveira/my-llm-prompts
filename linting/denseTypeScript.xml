	<variables>
		- Do not leave variables possibly typed as never (or Iterables of never) by the compiler, as commonly caused by 
				variables initialized as undefined or empty objects, as such, instead:
					- If there is some logic that can explicity type the variable, declare it
					- Else flag it with a comment appended before as // ! NEVER
	</variables>

		- Do not leave variables possibly typed as unknown (or Iterables of unknown) by the compiler, as commonly caused by 
				variables initialized as undefined or empty objects, as such, instead:
					- If there is some logic that can explicity type the variable, declare it
					- Else flag it with a comment appended before as // ! UNKNOWN
	</variables>
	<iterables>
		- Iterables should always have their types explicitly declared. 
				In the case of Arrays of more than one level of depth, all the levels above the first should be declared with generics 
					and direct alternating (e.g.: Array<Array<string[]>[]>)
