		- Always sort imports alphabetically at all levels;
		- Use a tab spacing for all lines inside of the @php/@endphp block;
		- Give a more log errors, with details about the files, the class of the error, etc, but DO NOT add stack tracing
		- Never use more than one newline to separate lines, EXCEPT for breaking 80+ columns lines;
		- Don't add comments;
		- I will be giving you php blocks that you must initialize the variables with their desired types as defaulted variations (with ??=, NOT =), and then start the procedures WITHIN try/catches to give their proper values (always with coalescence);
		- Include different types of exception catches if you see windows for diverse ones (besides the general \Throwable), including the corresponding import;
		- Always use {} spreading for the imports, preventing repetition;
		- The intention is to prevent at all costs that we get a sever crash by a null pointer leaking or an error being thrown without being catched;
		- DO NOT import Error or Exception, just call them by \Error and \Exception;
