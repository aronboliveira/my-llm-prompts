		- For each of these pseudo-classes: 
			(:active, :hover, :checked, :disabled, :enabled, :invalid, :valid, :empty, :(nth)-child, :(nth)-of-type, :required)
				a. Apply styling rules to them if you consider it valuable for UI/UX;
				b. Always apply for :active and :hover when considering highlighted tags, buttons (or inputs/divs that mirror buttons) and links
	- For each of these pseudo-elements: 
			(::selection, ::placeholder, ::marker, ::details-content, ::first-letter and ::first-line)
				Apply styling rules to them if you consider it valuable for UI/UX;
	- Adding a more modern SCSS, with box shadowing, text drop shadows, subtle gradient colors, cropped images, border radius and reactive css based on pseudoclasses and pseudoelements (mainly :hover, :active, ::selection, but others as you see fit)
	- Always sort the selectors alphabetically;
	- Always sort the rules by groups of functionally (e.g.: spacing, fonts, borders, etc.);
	- Matching the attached html and/or css visual identity, if any of those are found;
	</css>
	<sass>
		- Make broad usage of scss nesting;
		- Use scss variables when values repeat. Use scss mixins when blocks of styling repeat;
